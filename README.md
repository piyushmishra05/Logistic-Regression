# Logistic-Regression
This repository showcases my end-to-end learning of Logistic Regression, including data preprocessing, binary classification modeling, probability estimation, and evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC in Python.

This repository documents my structured learning and hands-on practice of **Logistic Regression**, a widely used classification algorithm in data analytics and machine learning. The notebooks focus on building, evaluating, and interpreting binary classification models using **Python (Jupyter Notebooks)**.
